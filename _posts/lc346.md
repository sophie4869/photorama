Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

For example,
MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
m.next(1) = 1
m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3

```c++
class MovingAverage {
    int win_size;
    deque<int> q;
    double sum = 0;
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    MovingAverage(int size) {
        win_size = size;
    }
    
    double next(int val) {
        if (q.size() >= win_size) {
            sum -= q.front();
            q.pop_front();
        }
        q.push_back(val);
        sum += val;
        return sum/double(q.size());
    }
};

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
 ```
