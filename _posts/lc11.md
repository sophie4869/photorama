Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int l = height.size();
        int left = 0, right = l-1;
        int mx = 0;
        while (left<right) {
            if (height[left]<height[right]) {
                int tmp = height[left]*(right-left);
                if (tmp>mx)
                    mx = tmp;
                left++;
            }
            else {
                int tmp = height[right]*(right-left);
                if (tmp>mx)
                    mx = tmp;
                right--;
            }
        }
        return mx;
    }
};
